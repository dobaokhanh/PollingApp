## Explaination
  * ### Security
    * #### Overview
      * Build an API that registers new users with their name, username, email and password
      * Build an API to let users login using their username/email and password. After validating user's credential, the API should generate JWT authentication token and return the token in the response.
      * Configure security to restrict access to protected resources
      * Configure security to throw 401 unauthorized error if a client tries to access protected resources.
      * Configure Role-based Authorization to protect resources on the sever.
    * #### Implementation
      * SecurityConfig:
        * @EnableWebSecurity: enable Spring Security's web security support and provide the Spring MVC intergration
        * @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity: enable method level security based on annotation
          * @securedEnabled: determine if the annotation @Secured annotation should be enable
          * @jsr250Enabled: enable the @RolesAllowed annotation
          * @prePostEnabled: enable more complex expression based access control syntax with @PreAuthorized and @PostAuthorized annotations
        * WebSecurityConfigureAdapter: Provides default security configurations and allows other classes to extend it and customize the security configuration by overrding its methods.
        * CustomerUserDetailService: authenticates a User or perform various role-based checks. This class implements UserDetailService interface that provides the implementation for `loadUserByUserName()` method.
        * JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint: return a 401 unauthorized error to clients that try to access protected resource without proper authentication. 
        * JwtAuthenticationFilter: implements a filter that:
          * reads JWT authentication token from the `Ã€uthorization` header of all requests
          * validates the JWT token
          * loads the user details associated with that token
          * Set the user details in Spring Security's `SecurityContext`. Spring Security uses the user details to perform authorization checks.
        * AuthenticationManagerBuilder and AuthenticationManager: `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` is used to created an `AuthenticationManager` instance which is the main Spring Security interface for authenticating user. `AuthenticationManager` is used to authenticate a user in login API
        * HttpSecurity configurations: `HttpSecurity` configurations are used to configure security functionalities like `csrf`, `sessionManagement`, and add the rules to protect resources.
